In this Playground we will dive into one way to attack this problem, which is called the Univector Field Navigation ‚ûö and is used for obstacle avoidance movement for robots! \nLet's start with an interactive example:"
    
    static let second = "That was an Attractive Univector Field, centered at the orange ball. As you may have noticed, the difference between an Univector and a regular Vector field is that all the vectors from the former have the same absolute value (or ‚Äùlenght‚Äù). Now let's add a little robot under influence of the field! You can also interact with the scene :D"
