    static let first = "How do we walk üö∂‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è? More importantly, how do we make something walk?! In this Playground we will dive into one way to attack this problem, which is called the Univector Field Navigation ‚ûö and is used for obstacle avoidance movement for robots! \nLet's start with an interactive example:"
    
    static let second = "That was an Attractive Univector Field, centered at the orange ball. As you may have noticed, the difference between an Univector and a regular Vector field is that all the vectors from the former have the same absolute value (or ‚Äùlenght‚Äù). Now let's add a little robot ü§ñ under influence of the field! You can also interact with the scene :D"
    
    static let third = "Wow üòç! That's already looking neat! Of course the attractive is only one of the infinite types of fields. Let's meet some other types that will help us improve our robot's movement. Another very simple field is the repulsive one:"
    
    static let fourth = "With those two fields we met, it's already possible to make something very interesting: combine both to make our pink and blue friend follow an attractive goal while also avoiding repulsive obstacles!"
    
    static let fifth = "Now, we will take a look at the attractive Hyperbolic Spiral Field. It may sound intimidating, but it‚Äôs really friendly! Being a spiral, we can choose between"
    
    static let sixth = "With those two fields we met, it's already possible to make something very interesting: combine both to make our pink and blue friend follow an attractive goal while also avoiding repulsive obstacles! Here you can experiment with"
